# 🌌 Quantum Machine Learning and Its Applications

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my **M.Tech Project** titled *Quantum Machine Learning and Its Applications*.  

The project investigates how **Quantum Computing** can be combined with **Machine Learning** to solve real-world problems more efficiently. It implements **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)**, **Quantum Kernels**, and **Hybrid Classical–Quantum models**, and compares their performance with traditional machine learning models.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore the **foundations of Quantum Computing** and Quantum Information Processing.  
- Implement **QML algorithms** for supervised learning (classification & regression).  
- Compare **classical ML vs. QML performance** on benchmark datasets (Iris, MNIST subsets).  
- Identify application domains where QML shows potential advantages (small data, high complexity).
